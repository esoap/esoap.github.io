What paths are our brain cells going, and what makes them get lost from the "typical" journey, causing numerous neurological conditions?
-----
Hello, my name is **Jihae Sophia Lee**, a **bioinformatician** at Korea University. <br>
I believe we are a **symphony of cell states**, and it fascinates me, as a single-cell researcher, how all these cells act as a whole to create me, you, and our brain! I believe that understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the cells will lead us to understand the whole organ, the **connectome**, and **related disorders**. <br>
Researchers have found risk genes through GWAS, and are further exploring their cell type-specific functions by single-cell omics. However, we find some genes in common across the disorders, with different cell type specificity. My current question is, how does this happen to have different effects? I aim to utilize **single-cell omics, isoforms, machine learning, and human-derived stem cells** to understand this **pleiotropic effect**.<br><br>
Introducing me, I am an intersection of a lot of things. <br>

* Being a bioinformatician means you are in between Biology and Computer Science <br>
*(Which are my two undergraduate majors..)*
* I have both Brazilian and Korean nationality 
<br> *(Feijoada and Kimchi are both my soul foods!! Yum)* 
* I just love to be with people, nature, and animals <br>*(especially dogs, **the white dog among my pictures is called Pong**)*. <br>
I want to bring this love and passion to my research. Please stay tuned for any updates about my journey!
