excerpt: '![atlas_fig1](http://esoap.github.io/images/Figure1_atlas.jpg)<br>
This study introduced the expression dynamics of neurological risk genes through human brain development by constructing a single-cell human brain atlas. <br>
We have uncovered distinct expression patterns of neurological disorder risk genes within cell differentiation trajectories and investigated the gene regulatory mechanisms during early brain development. <br><br>
Please check our [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10939707) for the Anndata and Seurat object of the atlas and gene dynamics plot for 3380 neurological risk genes!'
