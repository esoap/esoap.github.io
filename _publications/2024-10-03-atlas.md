excerpt: 'This study introduced the expression dynamics of neurological risk genes through human brain development by constructing a single-cell human brain atlas. <br>
We have uncovered distinct expression patterns of neurological disorder risk genes within cell differentiation trajectories and investigated the gene regulatory mechanisms during early brain development. <br>
Please check our [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10939707) for the Anndata and Seurat object of the atlas and gene dynamics plot for 3380 neurological risk genes!<br>
