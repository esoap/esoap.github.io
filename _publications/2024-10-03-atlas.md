This study leverages single-cell technologies to explore the development of the human brain and its connection to neurological disorders. 

By integrating multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, researchers constructed a comprehensive atlas of 393,060 cells across various developmental stages. The cell differentiation trajectory analysis uncovered distinct expression patterns of neurological disorder risk genes, within neuronal and glial lineages. 

Divergent neuronal lineages and molecularly defined nonneuronal cells showed stage-specific risk gene expression, suggesting links between cellular maturation and disorder susceptibility. 

Regulatory mechanisms during early brain development revealed enriched patterns in fetal cell types tied to prenatal influences on neurological disorders. 

These findings enhance understanding of dynamic risk gene alterations during brain development, enabling unbiased cell typeâ€’disorder associations and advancing knowledge of neurological disease mechanisms.
